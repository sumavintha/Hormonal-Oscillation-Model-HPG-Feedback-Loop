# Oscillation Model – HPG Axis Feedback Simulation


## Biological Context
This model reflects the dynamic feedback loop between:
- **H:** Hypothalamus
- **P:** Pituitary gland
- **G:** Gonads 

The value of **n** represents how sharply gonadal hormone levels regulate hypothalamic activity.

This interactive model simulates hormonal oscillations in the Hypothalamus–Pituitary–Gonadal (HPG) axis. This key regulatory feedback loop is critical in the regulation of the endocrine system, as dysregulation or dysfunction of the HPG axis can impact reproductive, psychiatric, and metabolic health. Built using JavaScript and Plotly.js, the model lets users explore how the feedback sensitivity parameter **n** affects hormone dynamics over time.

## Overview

-  **Real-time plotting** of hormone levels (H, P, G)
-  **Slider** to adjust sensitivity parameter `n`
-  **Euler’s Method** simulation of differential equations
-  Designed for learning systems biology & feedback dynamics
